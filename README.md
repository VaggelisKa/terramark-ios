# Terramark

**Terramark** is an iOS app that helps you track where you’ve been and where you want to go—all on a world map.

## What you can do

**📍 Track your travels**  
Tap any country on the map to mark it as **Visited or lived** or **Want to visit**. Your map updates with clear colors so you can see your progress at a glance.

**📊 See your stats**  
View how many countries you’ve visited and what share of the world that is. Stats break down by continent (e.g. Europe, Asia) so you can see which regions you’ve explored most.

**✨ Build a wishlist**  
Keep a “Want to visit” list and reorder it. Open it from the map to see all your dream destinations in one place.

**🎯 Set goals**  
Create personal goals to stay motivated, for example:

- Visit a certain number of countries (e.g. 50)
- Reach a percentage of the world (e.g. 25%)
- Visit a specific set of countries

You can add optional target dates and custom titles. Your progress is shown so you know how close you are.

**📖 Learn about countries**  
When you tap a country, you get a short overview, what it’s known for, and a quick history. When available, you can also see AI-generated travel insights and tips.

**📤 Share your map**  
Export your map as a screenshot or PDF and share it with friends or on social media.

**📱 Home screen widget**  
Add a widget to see your stats and goals without opening the app.

**🎨 Appearance**  
Choose light, dark, or system theme in Settings so the app matches how you use your device.
